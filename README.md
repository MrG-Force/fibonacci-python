# The Fibonacci number sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows

- The first element is 0
- The second element is 1
- The n<sup>th</sup> element is the sum of the (n-1)<sup>th</sup> and (n-2)<sup>th</sup> elements.

Therefore, the first 21 Fibonacci numbers are:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765
```
